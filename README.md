This is a website developed by me as a way to showcase some of the things that I've learnt.
Website was developed in React using Gatsby and utilised styled components.


Current ideas for website:
Mobile Menu
Smooth scrolling
3D animation
SVG text animation
SVG image animation
parallax effect
Framer Motion animation
Text fly in animation
Utilise Gatsby image to display image slideshow of past work and resume


liquid effect
browser game? maybe in the future
